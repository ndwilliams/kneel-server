# Kneel's Diamonds
We want to build an API for a jewelry store called Kneel's Diamonds, which is looking to allow customers to create custom orders based on the menu presented to them via the website.

We want a developer to be able to access information from a SQL table so that they may be able to present all the Sizing, Style, and Metal options on the website.
Additionally, we want all the orders to be presented on the page so that the store may have a record of all the orders that have been placed and its respective price.

The API should support POST, GET (single object), GET(array of all order objects), DELETE, and PUT methods for Orders, Sizes, Styles, and Metals.
Expanstion of any related resource on an order should also be supported. This will include metal, size, style, or any combination of these.
