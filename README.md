We want to build an API for a jewelry store looking to allow customers to create custom orders based on the menu presented to them via the website.

We want a developer to be able to access information from a SQL table so that they may be able to present all the Sizing, Style, and Metal options.
Additionally, when an order is placed, we want to support the ability to display the order number and its price.

The API should support POST, GET (single object), GET(array of all order objects), DELETE, and PUT methods for Orders, Sizes, Styles, and Metals.
Expanstion of any related resource on an order should also be supported. This will include metal, size, style, or any combination of these resources.
